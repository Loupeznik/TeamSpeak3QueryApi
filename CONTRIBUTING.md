- Please don't restructure the entire project or do other large changes because something is not right in your opinion. It may be bad, but please have a chat with us _beforehand_.
- Keep the project formatting. Plase don't change a global formatting option just because it's the way you do it. Don't auto-format parts of the code that you did not change.
- Try to keep a PR address _a single thing_, so we can test and deploy independently (don't resolve multiple issues with a single PR).
- [Keep things simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), even if Netflix solves things cooler. We're not Netflix. [Do it the boring way](http://boringtechnology.club).
