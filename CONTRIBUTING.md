# CONTRIBUTING.md
We value contributions! If you want to contribute code, we've some guidelines to make life easier for everyone:

## Keep structure.
Please don't restructure the entire project or do other large changes because something is not right in your opinion or there is some cool new language feature that everyone should use.

Maybe it is cool, but please have a chat with us _beforehand_.

## Keep PRs small.
Large PRs are always hard to merge. Keep PRs as small as possible to make it easier for everyone. When in doubt, split your changes into multiple PRs if possible. Or just ask beforehand.

## Change only what you changed.
Keep the project formatting. Please don't do stuff like changing global formatting options just because it's the way _you_ do it.

Don't format parts of the code that you did not touch.

## Address one thing only.
Try to keep a PR address _a single thing_, so we can test and deploy independently (don't resolve multiple issues with a single PR).

Try to [keep commits atomic](https://www.codewithjason.com/atomic-commits-testing/).

## Keep it simple.
[Keep things simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), even if Netflix solves things cooler. We're not Netflix. [Do it the boring way](http://boringtechnology.club).
